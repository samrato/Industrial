> 🧑‍🏫 **Instructor:** Willington Juma  
> 🏫 **Institution:** Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST)  
> 📅 **Period:** During Industrial Attachment  
> 🛠️ **Tech Stack:** Node.js | Express.js | MongoDB | Postman

## 📚 Project Overview

This project was developed and used as a **training resource** during my industrial attachment at MMUST, where I served as the **backend development instructor**.

Students were guided through practical lessons covering the entire backend development flow using **Express.js** and **MongoDB**, including:

- API design and routing
- CRUD operations
- RESTful architecture
- Mongoose ORM
- Testing with Postman
- Environment setup and modularization
